# FestariAppi
Android project that was done as a group of 4 people.

FestivalApp that ables to see where your friends are in the festival and you can see the weather of the festival city where you are going. Also list of festivals in Finland and a countdown to them.
Every festival has little info about them and a link to buy tickets. You can also mark festivals to your favorites and they will go to your favorite list, so its easier to see the festivals you are actually interested in.

Here is only login/registration as a code. For the sign in and sign up I used Firebase to authenticate and to proberly sign up.
Under is a video of the whole project: 

As note to whoever sees the video the password is not really used in anything.
